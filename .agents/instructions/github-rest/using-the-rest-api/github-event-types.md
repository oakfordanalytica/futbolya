# GitHub event types

For the GitHub Events API, learn about each event type, the triggering action on GitHub, and each event's unique properties.

The Events API can return different types of events triggered by activity on GitHub. Each event response contains shared properties, but has a unique `payload` object determined by its event type. The [Event object common properties](#event-object-common-properties) describes the properties shared by all events, and each event type describes the `payload` properties that are unique to the specific event.

## Event object common properties

The event objects returned from the Events API endpoints have the same structure.
